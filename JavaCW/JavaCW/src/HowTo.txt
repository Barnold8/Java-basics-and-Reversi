How to play!


Win by having the most discs on the board by the end of the game

Start by having 4 discs in the center. Diagonal colours.



FLANK:

   Lets imagine we are black. If we place a disc and there are white discs between the placed disc and
   another one of our discs, then we can flip the discs that are in between the blacks. Same goes for the white player
   vice versa situation.
